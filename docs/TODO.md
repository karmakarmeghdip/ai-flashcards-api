55. [ ] Design notification system for study reminders
56. [ ] Plan collaborative flashcard sharing features
57. [ ] Research additional flashcard types
58. [ ] Plan LMS integration endpoints

## Priority Order for MVP Development

For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), focus on completing these tasks first:

1. Core Infrastructure (tasks 1-7)
2. Basic CRUD for Topics and Flashcards (tasks 8-11)
3. LLM Integration for basic content generation (tasks 15-17)
4. Simple spaced repetition implementation (tasks 23-25)
5. Basic testing and documentation (tasks 45, 47)
6. Deployment setup (tasks 49-50)

This will give you a functional system that can:
- Allow users to create topics
- Generate syllabi and flashcards
- Provide spaced repetition learning
- Be deployed for testing

After validating the MVP, proceed with analytics, optimizations, and enhanced features.
